## Content

* digital-circuit-lab/MIPS\_pipeline\_out
  * CPU designed based on MIPS pipeline, platform: Xilinx ISE 14.7
  * Features: basic 16 instructions + 8 extra instructions, forwarding mechanism, dynamic branch prediction, Sparten 6 downloads, random memory acess, ordered memory access
  * Showing examples: Fibonacci array starting with 3,3, and saving into RAM units
  * Interrupt / Exception is not implemented
  * Instructions have already been tested by Mars simulator. No test codes included in this repo.
